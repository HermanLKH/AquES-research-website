He aims to deepen the understanding of microplastic pollution in Southeast Asian coastal environments and its solutions. His work extensively involves studying biogeochemical cycles and the impacts of microplastics on these systems. He holds a PhD in Biology and continues his postdoctoral research at Swinburne University of Technology Sarawak Campus, where he also teaches part-time. His expertise includes microbiology, molecular biology techniques such as DNA extraction and PCR, and plant tissue culture. Changi has engaged in community outreach programs aimed at raising awareness and reducing plastic waste through recycling and upcycling initiatives. His research and educational efforts underscore his commitment to tackling environmental issues, especially related to plastic pollution and its broader ecological impacts.",
